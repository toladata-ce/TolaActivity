# Tola Activity [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/toladata/TolaActivity.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/toladata/TolaActivity) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/toladata/TolaActivity/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/toladata/TolaActivity)

http://toladata.com/products/activity/

TolaActivity extends the functionality of TolaData to include a set of forms and
reports for managing project activities for a WorkflowLevel1.  It includes workflow for approving
and completing projects as well as sharing the output data.

TolaActivity functionality http://www.github.com/toladata/TolaActivity is intended to allow importing
and exporting of project specific data from 3rd party data sources or excel
files.


## Configuration

Location of settings:

* Development: `tola/settings/dev.py`
* Test runner: `tola/settings/test.py` and `tola/settings/test_pkg.py`
* Staging/Production: `tola/settings/local.py`


## Deploy changes in activity servers

Once all your changes have been commited to the repo, and before pushing them, run:
`. travis.sh`


## Deploy locally via Docker

Build first the images:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml build
```

To run the webserver (go to 127.0.0.1:8080):

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up # -d for detached
```

User: `admin`
Password: `admin`.

To run the tests:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml run --entrypoint '/usr/bin/env' --rm web python manage.py test # --keepdb to run second time faster
```

To run the package building tests, follow these steps:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml run --entrypoint '/usr/bin/env' --rm web bash
# Now inside the container
pip freeze | grep -v "^-e" | xargs pip uninstall -y; pip uninstall -y social_auth_core; cat requirements.txt | grep "^Django==\|^psycopg2" | xargs pip install; pip install -r requirements-pkg.txt
python manage.py test --tag=pkg --keepdb
```

To run the webserver with pdb support:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml run --rm --service-ports web
```

To run bash:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml run --entrypoint '/usr/bin/env' --rm web bash
```

or if you initialized already a container:

```bash
docker exec -it web bash
```

To connect to the database when the container is running:

```bash
docker exec -it postgres psql -U root tola_activity
```

If the database is empty, you may want to populate extra demo data to play
around with Activity:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml run --entrypoint '/usr/bin/env' --rm web python manage.py loadinitialdata  --demo
```

#### Issue with the local environment

If you're getting an error in your local environment, it can be related to 
the `social-core` library. To solve this issue you need to execute the 
following step:

- With the container running, go into it with this command:
  
  `docker exec -it web bash`
  
- Install the `social-core` lib again:

  `pip install -e git://github.com/toladata/social-core#egg=social-core`

- Now, restart the container.

It should solve the problem!


## Deploy locally using virtualenv

Given pip is installed:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

Create the environment:

```bash
virtualenv â€”no-site-packages venv
````

Note: use no site packages to prevent virtualenv from seeing your global packages.

Activate the environment:

```bash
. venv/bin/activate
```

or:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Set up database:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

Run the server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

## Development notes

### Setup a HTTPS development webserver to run Microsoft log in

As Microsoft requires HTTPS endpoints to be set in their Application
Registration Portal (https://apps.dev.microsoft.com), the easiest way to do it
is registering an account in ngrok.com, installing the software and running
both ngrok and Django development webserver at the same time.

With the URL displayed by ngrok, set it up in the Microsoft Application
Registration Portal like this:

* *Platforms >> Web >> Redirect URLs*: `https://<ID>.ngrok.io/complete/microsoft-graph`
* *Platforms >> Web >> Logout URL*: `https://<ID>.ngrok.io/accounts/logout`

Then set up the following environment variables in docker-compose-dev.yml:

* `SOCIAL_AUTH_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL=https://<ID>.ngrok.io`
* `SOCIAL_AUTH_MICROSOFT_GRAPH_REDIRECT_URL=https://<ID>.ngrok.io/complete/microsoft-graph`
* `TOLA_HOSTNAME=127.0.0.1,localhost,<ID>.ngrok.io`
